i think it was 2 years or more my personal website was down, that's because i'm lazy to manage and paying server for that. yea i need to pay for server because i use wordpress.

Now i moved to use static site using hugo and host it on netlify, so i just need to pay for domain only.

For the tutorial can follow link below:
